description: Framework for SuperBenefit Members to advocate for role modifications when normal team coordination isn't sufficient

# Role Advice Policy

This policy provides a framework for SuperBenefit Members to advocate for modifications to their Hats Protocol roles when normal team coordination processes aren't working or when authority structures have become calcified in ways that limit member agency.

## When This Policy Applies

Most role modifications happen through routine team coordination - cells and workstreams typically figure out roles organically and implement changes as needed through their multisigs or designated administrators. This policy exists for situations where normal coordination breaks down or where established role structures prevent members from adapting their contributions effectively.

Use this framework when you find yourself in situations like:
- Your team is resistant to role changes you believe would improve your effectiveness
- Authority structures have become rigid in ways that don't serve current needs
- You're unclear about who has authority to approve needed role modifications
- Normal team processes aren't addressing your concerns about role fit
- You need structured approach to build consensus for controversial role changes

This policy emphasizes that roles should serve as tools that give members agency rather than boxes that trap people within established norms unnecessarily.

## SuperBenefit's Hats Protocol Context

SuperBenefit uses Hats Protocol for onchain role management, with roles represented as ERC-1155 NFTs that gate access to tools and define authorities within our network. Roles can be held by individuals, cells, workstreams, or governance bodies, supporting our network-of-relationships approach to organization.

Role administration follows Hats Protocol's hierarchical structure:
- **Cell multisigs** typically serve as role admins for roles within their domain
- **Workstream admins** manage roles for decentralized workstreams that lack dedicated cells
- **General Circle** holds admin authority for organizational coordination roles
- **Community and Operational Governance** maintain authority over governance-related roles
- **Higher authorities** in the hat tree can administer roles below them in the hierarchy

Role modifications require execution by appropriate administrators, which usually means coordinating with multisig signers or designated admins to authorize and implement changes onchain.

## Role Modification Advocacy Framework

### Assess Your Situation

Begin by clarifying why you're seeking role modification and why normal team processes haven't addressed your needs. Consider what's driving your concerns - whether it's evolving interests, changing capacity, better alignment opportunities, or problems with how current roles constrain your contributions.

Identify who holds administrative authority over your role by checking the Hats Protocol hierarchy or consulting your cell's published role documentation. Understanding the authority structure helps you focus your advocacy efforts appropriately.

### Build Your Case

Develop a clear rationale for the role modification that addresses both your individual needs and collective benefits. Effective advocacy typically explains what's not working with current arrangements, how proposed changes would improve outcomes, and what transition approach would minimize disruption to ongoing work.

Consider how your proposed changes align with your team's objectives and SuperBenefit's broader mission. Role modifications that serve collective effectiveness alongside individual fulfillment tend to generate more support than changes that appear purely self-interested.

### Engage Relevant Stakeholders

Reach out to people who work closely with your role or would be affected by changes. This typically includes teammates who share similar roles, collaborators who depend on your current functions, and administrators who would need to implement modifications.

Use SuperBenefit's Discord channels to facilitate these conversations, focusing on understanding different perspectives rather than immediately advocating for your preferred solution. Often these discussions reveal creative alternatives that better serve everyone's needs.

### Navigate Administrative Authority

Work with appropriate role administrators to implement approved changes. For most roles, this means coordinating with your cell's multisig signers or designated admins who can execute onchain modifications through Hats Protocol.

If your immediate administrators are unresponsive or resistant, you can escalate to higher authorities in the hat tree hierarchy. However, approach escalation thoughtfully - often working through concerns with immediate administrators proves more effective than bypassing established coordination mechanisms.

### Document and Communicate

Once role modifications are implemented, ensure relevant stakeholders understand the changes and any implications for ongoing coordination. Role history is automatically documented onchain through Hats Protocol, and cells should update their published role documentation to reflect significant changes.

Communicate changes through appropriate Discord channels so that collaborators can adjust their coordination accordingly.

## Policy Evolution

This policy represents a starting framework that will evolve based on practical experience with role advocacy situations. As SuperBenefit's use of Hats Protocol matures and new coordination challenges emerge, the policy should be updated to better serve member agency while maintaining effective collective coordination.

Members experiencing challenges with role advocacy are encouraged to share feedback about policy effectiveness and suggest improvements based on their experiences. Platform governance maintains authority over policy modifications while welcoming input from anyone navigating role modification challenges.
