# Hats Protocol Governance Directory

This directory contains policies governing SuperBenefit's use of Hats Protocol for onchain role management. For conceptual understanding of Hats Protocol governance, see [index.md](index.md). This readme provides technical guidance for creating and modifying Hats Protocol policies within SuperBenefit's governance framework.

## Understanding Hats Protocol Policy Authority

Hats Protocol policies operate within SuperBenefit's platform governance domain, establishing social coordination frameworks that complement the technical capabilities of onchain role management. These policies bridge between human coordination needs and technical implementation through Hats Protocol smart contracts.

Platform governance maintains authority over digital infrastructure policies including those governing protocol-specific coordination mechanisms. Hats Protocol policies establish social coordination frameworks while respecting technical governance mechanisms built into the protocol itself and SuperBenefit's multisignature infrastructure.

## Policy Development Framework

Hats Protocol policies focus on the social coordination layer that supports effective onchain role management. They establish cultural frameworks for role development, modification, and administration while maintaining compatibility with the technical constraints and capabilities of Hats Protocol.

When developing policies in this domain, consider:

**Human-Centered Design**: Policies should prioritize participant needs and experiences over technical convenience, ensuring that onchain role management serves human flourishing and collective effectiveness.

**Technical Integration**: Social coordination frameworks must align with Hats Protocol's technical capabilities and constraints, creating seamless bridges between human decision-making and onchain implementation.

**Network Flexibility**: Policies should accommodate SuperBenefit's network-of-relationships approach, recognizing that roles can represent individuals, groups, cells, circles, or governance bodies.

**Authority Clarity**: Clear delineation between social coordination established by policies and technical authority implemented through role admins and multisignature infrastructure.

## Creating Hats Protocol Policies

New Hats Protocol policies are created through platform governance processes, following the authority structures established in SuperBenefit's broader governance framework. Policy creation should address specific coordination needs that emerge from practical experience with Hats Protocol implementation.

### Development Workflow

Hats Protocol policy development begins with identifying coordination challenges or opportunities related to onchain role management. These often emerge from practical experience with role administration, Member feedback about role development needs, or evolution in SuperBenefit's organizational structure.

Policy proposals should clearly articulate the social coordination need being addressed, explain how the proposed policy complements existing technical mechanisms, and demonstrate alignment with SuperBenefit's broader governance principles and community values.

## Modifying Existing Policies

Hats Protocol policies can be modified through platform governance processes when changes would improve social coordination or better align with evolving technical infrastructure. Modifications should maintain compatibility with existing role management systems while addressing identified improvement opportunities.

Policy modifications require careful consideration of their impact on existing role holders and coordination mechanisms. Changes should preserve continuity in essential coordination functions while enabling improved approaches to role development and administration.

## Integration Considerations

Hats Protocol policies must maintain alignment with:

**Community Agreements**: Social coordination frameworks should embody the cultural values and behavioral norms established through community governance.

**Technical Infrastructure**: Policies must remain compatible with Hats Protocol capabilities and SuperBenefit's multisignature and wallet infrastructure.

**Broader Platform Governance**: Coordination mechanisms should complement other digital infrastructure policies and maintain coherence across platform governance domains.

**Operational Coordination**: Role management policies should support rather than complicate the coordination mechanisms established through operational governance.

## Quality Considerations

Hats Protocol policies require attention to both social coordination effectiveness and technical implementation feasibility:

**Practical Effectiveness**: Ensure policies create coordination mechanisms that work given SuperBenefit's member capacity, technical infrastructure, and collaborative culture.

**Technical Compatibility**: Verify that social coordination frameworks can be effectively implemented through existing Hats Protocol and multisignature infrastructure.

**Cultural Alignment**: Policies should reinforce rather than conflict with community values and collaborative norms established through community agreements.

**Evolutionary Capacity**: Build in mechanisms for policy adaptation based on practical experience with onchain role management and evolving technical capabilities.

Hats Protocol policies succeed when they create seamless integration between human coordination needs and onchain implementation capabilities, enabling role management that serves both individual fulfillment and collective effectiveness within SuperBenefit's network-of-relationships approach to organization.
