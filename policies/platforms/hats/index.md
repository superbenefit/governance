# Hats Protocol Governance

This section contains policies governing SuperBenefit's use of Hats Protocol for onchain role management. These policies establish the social coordination frameworks that complement Hats Protocol's technical capabilities, ensuring that onchain role management serves both individual fulfillment and collective effectiveness.

## Understanding Hats Protocol in SuperBenefit

SuperBenefit uses Hats Protocol to create programmable, revocable, and delegatable role tokens that represent specific authorities and responsibilities throughout our network. These ERC-1155 NFTs serve as the technical foundation for role management while gating access to digital tools and coordination mechanisms that enable SuperBenefit's collaborative work.

The flexibility of Hats Protocol aligns well with SuperBenefit's network-of-relationships approach to organization. Roles can be held by any Ethereum address, enabling representation of individual contributors, working groups, cells, circles, or entire governance bodies. This technical capability supports the composable, adaptive coordination mechanisms that characterize SuperBenefit's approach to collective action.

## Social Coordination for Onchain Roles

While Hats Protocol provides the technical infrastructure for role management, effective coordination requires robust social mechanisms that honor both individual agency and collective stewardship. The policies in this section establish cultural frameworks that bridge between human coordination needs and onchain implementation capabilities.

These policies recognize that role modifications often reflect positive growth in both individual contributors and the organization itself. By creating structured approaches to role development and modification, SuperBenefit enables role evolution that serves personal fulfillment while maintaining the collaborative relationships essential to our collective work.

## Current Hats Protocol Policies

**[Role Advice Policy](role-advice-policy.md)** establishes the social coordination framework that SuperBenefit Members use when considering modifications to roles they hold or share authority over. This policy creates cultural foundations for thoughtful role development that precedes onchain implementation.

Additional Hats Protocol policies will be developed as SuperBenefit's role management needs evolve and new coordination challenges emerge through practice.

## Authority and Implementation

Hats Protocol policies operate within SuperBenefit's platform governance domain, which maintains authority over digital infrastructure including protocols that support our coordination mechanisms. These policies establish social coordination frameworks while respecting the technical governance mechanisms built into Hats Protocol and SuperBenefit's multisignature infrastructure.

Role modifications require authorization from appropriate role admins or execution through multisignature wallets that hold administrative authority over relevant role trees. The social coordination established by these policies helps prepare well-considered proposals that enable efficient technical implementation while respecting collaborative relationships.

## Integration with Broader Governance

Hats Protocol governance policies complement rather than replace other governance mechanisms within SuperBenefit. They create specific frameworks for onchain role coordination while operating within the broader platform governance domain and maintaining alignment with community agreements that establish cultural foundations for all SuperBenefit activities.

As SuperBenefit's use of Hats Protocol evolves, additional policies may address role creation procedures, administrative frameworks, or integration with other digital infrastructure. These policies will continue to emphasize human-centered approaches to technology governance that serve both individual agency and collective effectiveness.
