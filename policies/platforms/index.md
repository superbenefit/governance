description: An index of platform policies for SuperBenefit
---

Welcome to the platforms section of our policy documentation. This area contains policies that govern our digital infrastructure – the tools, systems, and online spaces that enable collaboration across SuperBenefit.

## Understanding Platform Policies

Platform governance recognizes that digital tools profoundly shape how we interact and collaborate. Rather than treating infrastructure as merely technical, we approach it as a critical extension of our governance, ensuring our digital spaces embody SuperBenefit's values of inclusivity, transparency, and purposeful action.

Like operations, platform governance has delegated authority as defined in our agreements. This enables responsive technical management while maintaining accountability to broader community input for significant changes affecting participation.

Platform policies coordinate closely with our [operational policies](../operations/) to ensure that digital infrastructure supports rather than constrains effective work coordination, and with our [metagovernance policies](../metagovernance/) to ensure that technology serves democratic participation rather than replacing it.

## Current Platform Policies

### Hats Protocol Governance

SuperBenefit uses Hats Protocol for onchain role management throughout our network. [Hats Protocol policies](hats/) establish the social coordination frameworks that complement the technical capabilities of this role management infrastructure.

**[Role Advice Policy](hats/role-advice-policy.md)** establishes the social coordination framework that SuperBenefit Members use when considering modifications to roles managed through Hats Protocol. This policy creates cultural foundations for discussing and coordinating role changes that are ultimately implemented onchain.

Additional platform policies will be developed as SuperBenefit's digital infrastructure needs become clear through use.

## SuperBenefit's Distinctive Approach to Platform Governance

SuperBenefit treats digital infrastructure decisions as governance decisions rather than purely technical choices. We recognize that every platform configuration, permission structure, and interface design either enables or constrains different forms of participation, making technology choices fundamentally political acts that should align with our values rather than defaulting to technical convenience.

Our commitment to human-centered design means prioritizing participant needs over administrative efficiency or technical elegance. Rather than forcing people to adapt to technological constraints, we configure digital spaces to support the kinds of collaboration and participation that our community values require. This includes ensuring accessibility across different technical comfort levels and creating multiple pathways for meaningful engagement.

Platform governance serves democratic participation by ensuring that technology amplifies rather than replaces human agency in collective decision-making. Digital tools should make it easier for people to participate meaningfully in governance rather than creating barriers or concentrating influence among those with technical expertise. This approach treats technology as infrastructure for community empowerment rather than as a substitute for human relationship and deliberation.

## Developing Platform Policies

Platform policies adapt to rapidly changing digital environments while maintaining our commitment to creating spaces that serve human collaboration rather than constraining it. This domain prioritizes user needs and accessibility in all policy development.
