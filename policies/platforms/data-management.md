# Data Management and Privacy Policy

This policy establishes the authority framework for managing member data and protecting privacy within SuperBenefit's governance systems.

## Data Management Principles

SuperBenefit collects only minimum data necessary for governance functions. Member privacy receives protection appropriate to data sensitivity while maintaining transparency required for governance accountability. Data practices follow applicable legal requirements.

## Data Categories

Public governance data includes voting records and proposal participation necessary for transparent decision-making. Member verification data supports eligibility confirmation while protecting personal information. The distinction between public governance activities and private member information guides appropriate handling.

## Member Rights

Members maintain rights regarding their personal data including access, correction, and deletion consistent with governance record-keeping requirements. General Circle roles coordinate member requests within boundaries established by this policy.

## Authority

General Circle roles maintain delegated authority for data management operations within boundaries established by governance processes. The appropriate governance body retains ultimate authority over data management frameworks. All data handling must comply with SuperBenefit's agreements and applicable regulations.
