# Data Management and Privacy Policy

**Status**: To be developed within 24 months of Operating Agreement effective date

## Purpose

This policy will establish comprehensive frameworks for managing Member data, protecting privacy, and ensuring compliance with applicable data protection regulations while maintaining governance transparency and organizational functionality.

## Operating Agreement Compliance Requirements

The Operating Agreement requires this policy to address:

- Member data collection, storage, and management procedures
- Privacy protection measures and Member rights regarding personal information
- Compliance with Marshall Islands data protection requirements and applicable international regulations
- Access controls for sensitive governance and membership information
- Data retention and deletion policies balancing organizational needs with privacy rights
- Integration with transparency requirements for governance processes

## Key Policy Development Considerations

- **Privacy by Design**: Technical and procedural approaches that protect Member privacy while enabling necessary governance functions
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Adherence to applicable data protection laws including GDPR, CCPA, and Marshall Islands requirements
- **Member Rights**: Clear procedures for Members to access, correct, or delete personal information
- **Data Minimization**: Collection and retention of only data necessary for legitimate organizational functions
- **Security Safeguards**: Technical and administrative measures protecting Member data from unauthorized access or breach
- **Transparency Balance**: Balancing governance transparency requirements with individual privacy protection

## Data Categories Framework

**Public Governance Data**: Voting records, proposal participation, and other information necessary for governance transparency and accountability.

**Member Verification Data**: Information required for membership eligibility verification and compliance with organizational policies.

**Communication Data**: Records of Member interactions through official platforms, subject to privacy protections and retention limits.

**Financial Data**: Information related to resource allocation, contributions, and organizational financial activities.

## Privacy Rights Framework

- **Access Rights**: Member ability to view personal data held by the organization
- **Correction Rights**: Procedures for Members to correct inaccurate personal information
- **Deletion Rights**: Member ability to request deletion of personal data consistent with organizational record-keeping requirements
- **Portability Rights**: Member ability to export personal data in standard formats
- **Consent Management**: Clear procedures for obtaining and managing Member consent for data processing

## Implementation Timeline

This policy framework will be developed through SuperBenefit DAO's governance processes during the first 24 months following Operating Agreement adoption. Interim data management may proceed through General Circle oversight with Member guidance.

Development priorities:
1. Basic privacy protection and Member rights procedures (Months 1-6)
2. Regulatory compliance frameworks and data security measures (Months 6-12)
3. Advanced privacy features and consent management systems (Months 12-18)
