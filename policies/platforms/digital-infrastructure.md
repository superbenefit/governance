# Digital Infrastructure and Repository Management Policy

**Status**: To be developed within 24 months of Operating Agreement effective date

## Purpose

This policy will establish the comprehensive framework for managing SuperBenefit DAO's digital infrastructure, including official online venues, governance repository organization, and technical platform administration as referenced in the Operating Agreement.

## Operating Agreement Compliance Requirements

The Operating Agreement requires this policy to address:

- Official online venues designation and management procedures
- DAO State governance repository organization and maintenance standards
- Public accessibility and transparency protocols for governance documentation
- Version control and change tracking procedures for governance evolution
- Integration with broader Platform Policies for technical infrastructure coordination
- Archive maintenance and historical preservation of governance decisions

## Key Policy Development Considerations

- **Governance Repository Management**: Standards for organizing, maintaining, and updating the DAO State documentation
- **Public Accessibility**: Ensuring governance information remains accessible to all Members and external stakeholders
- **Version Control Integration**: Technical procedures for tracking governance changes and maintaining historical records
- **Platform Selection Criteria**: Standards for evaluating and selecting digital infrastructure that serves organizational needs
- **Security and Reliability**: Technical safeguards protecting governance infrastructure while maintaining accessibility
- **Decentralization Principles**: Infrastructure approaches that avoid single points of failure or control

## Digital Infrastructure Framework

**Governance Repository**: Centralized documentation system containing agreements, policies, and proposal archives with version control and public access.

**Communication Platforms**: Official venues for Member discussion, coordination, and governance deliberation with appropriate moderation and accessibility features.

**Voting Infrastructure**: Technical systems enabling secure, verifiable Member voting with privacy protection and transparency features.

**Archive Systems**: Long-term preservation systems for governance history, proposal records, and organizational memory.

## Integration Requirements

- **Platform Policies**: Coordination with broader platform governance for technical infrastructure decisions
- **State Management Policies**: Alignment with repository update procedures and quality assurance frameworks
- **Membership Management**: Integration with member verification and access control systems
- **Voting Procedures**: Technical infrastructure supporting Member voting and delegation mechanisms

## Implementation Timeline

This policy framework will be developed through SuperBenefit DAO's governance processes during the first 24 months following Operating Agreement adoption. Interim infrastructure management may proceed through General Circle coordination and Member oversight.

Development priorities:
1. Governance repository standards and maintenance procedures (Months 1-6)
2. Communication platform policies and moderation frameworks (Months 6-12)
3. Voting infrastructure and security protocols (Months 12-18)
4. Archive systems and long-term preservation strategies (Months 18-24)
