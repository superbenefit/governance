description: Framework for managing SuperBenefit's digital infrastructure and governance repository
---

This policy establishes the authority framework for managing SuperBenefit's digital infrastructure, including our governance repository and official online venues.

## Repository Management

The DAO State repository serves as the canonical source of truth for SuperBenefit's governance documentation. Repository management authority is delegated to General Circle roles, who ensure public accessibility and version control while maintaining documentation integrity.

All substantive changes to governance documentation must trace to legitimate governance decisions. Administrative corrections may proceed without formal approval. Version control maintains complete change history for transparency and accountability.

## Official Online Venues

SuperBenefit designates official venues for governance activities. General Circle roles maintain authority to manage these venues within boundaries established by governance processes. Current official venues include platforms for discussion, voting, and documentation, with specific designations maintained separately from this policy.

## Public Access

Governance documentation remains publicly accessible to support transparency and accountability. Access controls protect against unauthorized modifications while maintaining open read access to all governance records.

## Authority

General Circle roles exercise delegated authority over digital infrastructure within boundaries established by governance processes. The appropriate governance body retains ultimate authority to modify this framework. Infrastructure decisions must align with SuperBenefit's multi-stakeholder governance structure and commitment to transparency.
