# Voting Procedures Policy

**Status**: To be developed within 24 months of Operating Agreement effective date

## Purpose

This policy will establish the specific procedures, thresholds, and mechanisms for Member voting as referenced in the Operating Agreement. The policy must enable legitimate Member decision-making while protecting the organization's fundamental structure through appropriate safeguards.

## Operating Agreement Compliance Requirements

The Operating Agreement requires this policy to address:

- Voting weight determination based on membership mechanism
- Quorum requirements for valid decisions  
- Voting thresholds for different decision types
- Delegation mechanisms allowing Members to delegate voting authority
- Constitutional amendment procedures with heightened approval requirements
- Dissolution procedures requiring Member approval

## Proposal Categories Framework

Following DAOIP-4 standards, SuperBenefit DAO recognizes:

**Metagovernance Proposals**: Changes to governance structures, processes, and foundational agreements including Operating Agreement amendments.

**Treasury Proposals**: Resource allocation, budget decisions, spending authorizations, and financial management matters.

**Protocol Proposals**: Technical implementation decisions (currently not used by SuperBenefit DAO but framework available for future adoption).

## Key Policy Development Considerations

- **Constitutional Protection**: Heightened thresholds for Operating Agreement amendments and fundamental organizational changes
- **Accessibility**: Voting procedures must accommodate diverse technical comfort levels and participation styles
- **Transparency**: Clear, verifiable voting processes with public results
- **Delegation Framework**: Secure, revocable delegation system respecting Member autonomy
- **Emergency Procedures**: Expedited processes for urgent decisions while maintaining appropriate safeguards

## Implementation Timeline

This policy framework will be developed through SuperBenefit DAO's governance processes during the first 24 months following Operating Agreement adoption. Interim voting procedures may be established through Member governance processes to ensure operational continuity during policy development.

Development priorities:
1. Basic voting mechanics and thresholds (Months 1-6)
2. Delegation and accessibility features (Months 6-12) 
3. Constitutional amendment procedures (Months 12-18)
4. Emergency and specialized voting processes (Months 18-24)
