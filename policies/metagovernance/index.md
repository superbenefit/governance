# SuperBenefit Metagovernance Policies

Welcome to the metagovernance section of our policy documentation. This area contains the frameworks that guide how we make collective decisions, evolve our governance, and resolve conflicts. These policies establish the processes through which other governance decisions gain legitimacy.

## Understanding Metagovernance

Metagovernance policies define the rules of the game for all other decision-making. While operational policies focus on specific activities, metagovernance creates the context in which all governance happens. These policies determine who can make what decisions, through which processes, and with what authority.

Effective metagovernance balances structure with adaptability. The framework needs enough consistency to be predictable and trusted, but enough flexibility to evolve as the organization grows and learns.

## Current Metagovernance Policies

**[State Management](state/)** policies govern how we maintain this governance repository, ensuring that documented agreements and policies accurately reflect collective decisions. These policies establish approval processes for different types of updates and maintain the integrity of our governance documentation.

Other metagovernance policies are still being developed. Additional frameworks for proposal processes, voting mechanisms, and dispute resolution will be added as SuperBenefit's governance needs become clear through practice.

## SuperBenefit's Distinctive Approach to Metagovernance

SuperBenefit's metagovernance reflects our commitment to treating governance itself as open-source infrastructure. By maintaining our governance documentation in a git-based repository, we apply software development principles to organizational coordination – enabling version control, transparent change tracking, and collaborative improvement of our governance systems themselves.

Our state management policies exemplify this approach, recognizing that the integrity of governance documentation is foundational to effective coordination. Rather than treating governance as abstract rules, we understand it as living infrastructure that requires active maintenance, clear update processes, and continuous alignment with actual practice. This creates governance that evolves transparently rather than through backroom negotiations or individual preferences.

The multi-stakeholder governance structure – distinguishing between community and operational decision-making – enables appropriate participation while maintaining clear authority boundaries. This structure reflects our understanding that different types of decisions require different levels of expertise and involvement, enabling both democratic participation and effective coordination without forcing uniform approaches to all governance questions.

## Contributing to Metagovernance

Metagovernance policies require the highest standards of deliberation because they affect all other governance activities. Changes to these policies should involve broad participation and careful consideration of how modifications will impact the entire governance system.

For questions about metagovernance policies or to contribute to their development, engage through established governance channels or contact current governance facilitators.
