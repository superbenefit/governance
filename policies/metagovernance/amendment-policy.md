description: Procedures for modifying SuperBenefit's governance structures while protecting fundamental rights

# Amendment Policy

This policy establishes how SuperBenefit's governance evolves while balancing stability with adaptability. Different types of changes require different approval thresholds, ensuring fundamental elements receive appropriate protection.

## Amendment Categories

SuperBenefit distinguishes between major and minor governance changes. Major changes, including Operating Agreement amendments, require onchain governance through the process implemented in the governance body's smart contract on Aragon. These fundamental modifications receive heightened scrutiny through onchain voting to protect core Member rights and organizational structure.

Minor changes within established policy domains follow offchain governance processes as stated in the relevant body's agreements. Governance bodies with delegated authority over specific domains may modify policies within their scope using their established offchain processes, enabling responsive adaptation without requiring onchain votes.

Cross-domain changes affecting multiple policy areas require coordination between affected authorities. Whether these constitute major or minor changes depends on their scope and impact on fundamental governance structures.

## Safeguards

Certain fundamental rights cannot be amended away, including Member voting rights, non-profit status, and multi-stakeholder governance structure. These constitutional protections are enforced through the onchain governance requirements for major changes, ensuring the organization's essential character persists through governance evolution.

## Implementation

Approved amendments include implementation timelines ensuring smooth transitions. All changes, whether executed through onchain or offchain governance, are recorded in the DAO State. Version control maintains complete amendment history, providing transparency about governance evolution. All amendments must integrate with existing governance frameworks, maintaining system coherence.
