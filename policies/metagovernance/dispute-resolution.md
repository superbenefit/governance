# Dispute Resolution Policy

**Status**: To be developed within 24 months of Operating Agreement effective date

## Purpose

This policy will establish procedures for resolving disputes arising under the Operating Agreement or relating to SuperBenefit DAO activities. The policy must provide fair, accessible pathways for addressing conflicts while maintaining organizational integrity and community relationships.

## Operating Agreement Compliance Requirements

The Operating Agreement requires this policy to address:

- Procedures for mediation, arbitration, and appeals
- Resolution processes for disputes arising under the Operating Agreement
- Integration with broader governance dispute resolution mechanisms
- Binding nature of dispute resolution procedures on all Members
- Fair procedures balancing individual rights with community protection

## Key Policy Development Considerations

- **Accessibility**: Dispute resolution procedures must accommodate diverse participants and situations
- **Restoration Focus**: Emphasis on learning and relationship repair where possible
- **Due Process**: Fair procedures with appropriate review and appeals mechanisms
- **Community Protection**: Safeguards for organizational integrity and Member safety
- **Integration**: Coordination with other governance policies and community agreements
- **Timeliness**: Reasonable timelines that balance thoroughness with prompt resolution

## Dispute Categories Framework

**Governance Disputes**: Disagreements about policy interpretation, decision-making processes, or governance procedures.

**Membership Disputes**: Conflicts related to membership status, verification, or cessation procedures.

**Community Standards**: Issues involving community agreements, behavioral expectations, or collaborative principles.

**Resource Conflicts**: Disputes regarding resource allocation, stewardship, or financial matters.
