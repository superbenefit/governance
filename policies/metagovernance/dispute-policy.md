# Dispute Resolution

This policy is currently under development through SuperBenefit's governance processes. When complete, it will provide pathways for addressing disagreements constructively and appealing decisions when necessary, covering conflicts that may arise in community contexts or within SuperBenefit DAO operations.

## Development Status

This policy area has been identified as necessary for SuperBenefit's operations but is pending formal development and approval through appropriate governance channels. The policy will establish frameworks for handling conflicts across all SuperBenefit contexts, ensuring fair processes for raising concerns and appealing decisions.

## Getting Involved

Community members and SuperBenefit DAO contributors interested in contributing to this policy's development should engage through established governance processes. This includes participating in governance discussions on Discord and contributing to formal proposal development when opportunities arise.

For updates on this policy's development, monitor our governance forums and Discord channels where policy development discussions take place.
