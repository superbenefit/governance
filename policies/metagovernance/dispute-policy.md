# Dispute Resolution Policy

This policy establishes the framework for resolving disputes that arise within SuperBenefit, whether concerning governance decisions, member relationships, or resource allocation. Our approach emphasizes restoration and learning over punishment, recognizing that healthy conflict resolution strengthens collaborative capacity.

## Philosophy

SuperBenefit's dispute resolution reflects our understanding that disagreement is natural in collaborative work. Rather than eliminating conflict, we create structured pathways for constructive resolution. This restoration-focused approach prioritizes repairing relationships and addressing underlying issues over assigning blame, aligning with our commitment to regenerative organizational culture.

## Resolution Framework

Disputes begin with informal resolution through direct communication, supported by community agreements. When informal processes prove insufficient, parties may request facilitation from General Circle role holders. General Circle roles coordinate appointment of mediators who help parties find mutually acceptable solutions without imposing outcomes.

Formal escalation occurs only when informal processes fail. Parties submit written requests to General Circle role holders, who coordinate convening resolution panels following principles established in our agreements. Resolution timelines target 30-60 days, balancing thoroughness with prompt resolution.

## Authority

General Circle roles maintain authority over dispute resolution processes within boundaries established by governance processes. The appropriate governance body retains ultimate authority to modify this framework. All resolutions must align with SuperBenefit's agreements and multi-stakeholder governance structure.
