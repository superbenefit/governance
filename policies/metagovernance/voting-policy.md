# Voting Mechanisms

This policy is currently under development through SuperBenefit's governance processes. When complete, it will establish how we determine collective will on important questions, including decision rights, thresholds, and delegation options across different SuperBenefit contexts.

## Development Status

This policy area has been identified as necessary for SuperBenefit's operations but is pending formal development and approval through appropriate governance channels. The policy will address vote counting, decision authority in different contexts, voting thresholds for various decision types, and delegation mechanisms for community members and SuperBenefit DAO contributors.

## Getting Involved

Community members and SuperBenefit DAO contributors interested in contributing to this policy's development should engage through established governance processes. This includes participating in governance discussions on Discord and contributing to formal proposal development when opportunities arise.

For updates on this policy's development, monitor our governance forums and Discord channels where policy development discussions take place.
