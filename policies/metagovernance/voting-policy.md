# Voting Policy

This policy establishes basic voting mechanisms for shared metagovernance decisions within SuperBenefit. These mechanisms apply when governance bodies coordinate on matters affecting shared resources, though individual governance bodies may adopt or adapt these rules for their own internal use.

## Voting Weight

Voting power is determined by $SPRB token holdings. Each participant's voting weight equals the number of $SPRB tokens they hold at the time of proposal submission. This token-weighted system aligns voting influence with participation in the SuperBenefit ecosystem while maintaining the non-economic, governance-focused nature of participation rights.

The $SPRB token represents reputation and governance rights within SuperBenefit, not ownership or economic interest. Token distribution mechanisms and eligibility requirements are established in the Contributor Eligibility Policy.

## Delegation

Participants may delegate their voting power to other addresses, enabling expertise and trust to guide collective decision-making. Delegation remains revocable, allowing participants to reclaim their voting power at any time before a vote concludes. Delegated votes are calculated and displayed transparently to maintain accountability in the decision-making process.

## Quorum

Proposals require participation from at least 20% of total voting power to be valid. This baseline ensures sufficient participation for legitimacy while recognizing that different governance bodies may establish higher quorum requirements for decisions within their jurisdiction.

## Voting Timeline

The standard voting period is seven days. Individual governance bodies may establish different timelines for decisions within their authority, particularly for time-sensitive operational matters.

## Governance Body Autonomy

Each governance body within SuperBenefit maintains its own governance processes encoded in smart contracts. This policy establishes baseline standards for shared metagovernance decisions while preserving each body's autonomy to determine specific voting rules, platforms, and procedures for their internal governance.

When decisions affect shared resources such as the ENS token, Top Hat administration, or community treasury, the relevant governance bodies coordinate to ensure appropriate stakeholder participation while respecting each body's established processes.

## Transparency

All proposals, voting records, and outcomes are maintained in the public Proposal Archive within the DAO State. This transparency enables accountability and helps participants learn from past decisions. Each governance body determines its own voting platform while ensuring that decision records are preserved for institutional memory.
