# Voting Policy

This policy establishes the basic voting mechanisms for Member decision-making within SuperBenefit DAO as required by the Operating Agreement.

## Voting Weight

Voting power is determined by $SPRB token holdings. Each Member's voting weight equals the number of $SPRB tokens they hold at the time of proposal submission. This token-weighted system aligns voting influence with participation in the SuperBenefit ecosystem while maintaining the non-economic, governance-focused nature of membership rights.

The $SPRB token represents reputation and governance rights within SuperBenefit DAO, not ownership or economic interest. Token distribution mechanisms and eligibility requirements are established in the Contributor Eligibility Policy.

## Quorum

Proposals require participation from at least 20% of total voting power to be valid.

## Voting Timeline

The standard voting period is seven days. Members may change their vote during the voting period, with only the final position counting.

## Transparency

All proposals, voting records, and outcomes are maintained in the public Proposal Archive within the DAO State. This transparency enables accountability and helps Members learn from past decisions.
