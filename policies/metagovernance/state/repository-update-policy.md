title: Repository Update Policy
description: Core policies governing updates and maintenance of the SuperBenefit DAO governance repository
---

This document establishes the framework for maintaining and updating the SuperBenefit DAO governance state repository. These policies ensure that changes to our governance documentation follow legitimate processes while maintaining transparency, accuracy, and alignment with our distributed governance principles.

## Policy Purpose and Scope

The SuperBenefit DAO governance repository serves as the canonical source of truth for our organizational agreements, policies, and governance history. Unlike traditional organizations where governance documents might be scattered across various platforms or controlled by central authorities, our distributed approach requires clear protocols for maintaining this shared documentation.

State management policies create the necessary structure to ensure that governance documentation remains accurate, accessible, and reflective of actual collective decisions rather than individual interpretations. These policies distinguish between different types of updates based on their significance and potential impact on organizational governance, applying appropriate approval processes for each category.

Effective state management balances accessibility with integrity. While we want to enable responsive updates to keep documentation current, we also need safeguards to ensure that changes reflect legitimate governance processes rather than arbitrary modifications. This balance supports our commitment to transparent, participatory governance while maintaining the reliability of our governance infrastructure.

## Content Categories and Approval Requirements

The governance repository contains several distinct types of content, each with different management requirements reflecting their role in organizational governance.

### Organizational Information Updates

Updates to basic organizational information, contact details, current project status, and similar administrative content generally do not require formal governance approval. These updates help keep the repository current and useful while not affecting fundamental governance structures or processes.

Repository maintainers may make organizational information updates directly, provided they notify the community through appropriate channels and allow for feedback during regular governance discussions. If any community member raises substantive concerns about an organizational update, the change should be reviewed through standard governance processes.

### Agreement and Policy Modifications

Changes to foundational agreements and operational policies require approval through our established governance processes before implementation in the repository. This requirement preserves the legitimacy of our governance framework by ensuring that documented agreements accurately reflect collective decisions.

Agreement modifications, including changes to community agreements and operational agreements, must originate from formal proposals submitted through community governance. These proposals should clearly identify what changes are being made, why they are necessary, and how they align with organizational purpose and values.

Policy updates within specific domains may follow the governance processes established for those domains, provided the changes remain within existing authority boundaries. Cross-domain policy changes or modifications that affect fundamental governance structures require broader community approval.

### Operating Agreement Changes

Modifications to the operating agreement, including amendments or revisions, require heightened approval processes due to their legal and structural significance. Any proposed changes must first be developed through community governance processes, ensuring broad participation in considering modifications to our foundational legal documents.

All operating agreement changes must be reviewed for legal compliance and organizational alignment before implementation. The review process should consider whether proposed changes maintain our legal structure, preserve member protections, and support our organizational purpose effectively.

Approved operating agreement modifications must be implemented consistently across all relevant documentation, ensuring that legal documents, governance policies, and operational procedures remain aligned. This consistency prevents confusion and maintains the integrity of our governance framework.

### Archive Maintenance

Governance archives should be updated promptly as new decisions are made and implemented. Archive maintenance creates historical records that support accountability and institutional learning while providing context for future governance decisions.

Proposal archives must be updated whenever formal governance proposals reach resolution, regardless of outcome. Archive entries should include the complete proposal text, discussion context, voting results, and implementation status to provide comprehensive historical records.

Treasury and resource allocation decisions should be documented in appropriate archives along with their governance approval records. This documentation creates transparency about resource stewardship and enables communities to verify that approved allocations are implemented as intended.

## Governance Integration Principles

State management policies are designed to support rather than replace our distributed governance processes. All significant content changes must trace to legitimate governance decisions made through our established processes, ensuring that repository maintenance serves community authority rather than substituting for it.

When gaps emerge between documented governance and actual practices, resolution should prioritize determining whether practices should align with existing documentation or whether governance processes should develop updated approaches. This ensures that the repository accurately reflects current governance while maintaining appropriate change processes.

Disputes regarding repository content or state management should be addressed through our standard dispute resolution mechanisms. These processes provide pathways for community members to raise concerns and seek resolution while maintaining the integrity of governance documentation.

## Quality Assurance Framework

Repository maintainers are responsible for ensuring that implemented changes accurately reflect approved governance decisions. This includes verifying that changes adhere to authorized modifications, reviewing documentation for internal consistency, and maintaining clear connections between governance decisions and their implementation.

All state changes should be documented in the governance archive along with references to the authorizing governance decisions. This documentation creates traceable connections between community decisions and repository modifications, supporting accountability and historical understanding.

Minor corrections such as typographical errors, broken links, or formatting improvements may be made without formal governance approval, provided they do not alter content meaning. Such changes should be communicated to the community and reviewed during regular governance meetings to ensure transparency.

## Implementation Standards

Repository changes should be implemented through version-controlled processes that maintain clear records of what was changed, when, and by whom. This creates audit trails that support accountability while enabling community members to track governance evolution over time.

Changes should generally address single issues or closely related modifications to maintain clarity about what each update accomplishes. Omnibus changes that address multiple unrelated governance topics should be avoided as they make it difficult to track specific policy evolution and may complicate future governance decisions.

Implementation should preserve the integrity of governance decisions by accurately translating approved policies into repository content. Maintainers should not modify approved language unless necessary for technical formatting, and such modifications should be clearly documented and justified.

## Policy Review and Evolution

These state management policies themselves are subject to review and modification through our standard governance processes. As our organization evolves and learns from experience, these policies should adapt to better serve our governance needs while maintaining their fundamental purpose of supporting transparent, accountable documentation practices.

Regular review of state management effectiveness should consider whether current policies adequately support governance transparency, enable responsive documentation updates, prevent inappropriate modifications, and serve the broader community's needs. Feedback from repository users and governance participants should inform policy improvements.

The goal of state management remains supporting our distributed governance model by providing reliable, accessible, and accurate documentation of our collective agreements and decisions. These policies succeed when they enable effective governance participation rather than creating barriers to community engagement or repository maintenance.
