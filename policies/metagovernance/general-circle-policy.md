# General Circle Policy

This policy establishes the basic framework for SuperBenefit's General Circle. The General Circle facilitates coordination in shared governance spaces between SuperBenefit's multiple governance bodies.

## Purpose

The General Circle facilitates coordination across SuperBenefit initiatives, particularly in matters affecting shared resources and cross-body collaboration. It operates as both a coordination mechanism and a decision-making body within the authority delegated to it by community and operational governance bodies.

## Composition

The General Circle consists of active SuperBenefit participants who volunteer for coordination functions. The Circle maintains a size of 5-6 members to balance diverse perspectives with effective coordination.

Selection authority for new General Circle members rests with existing Circle members, who evaluate volunteers based on demonstrated commitment to SuperBenefit's mission and capacity for cross-body coordination. The Circle may establish its own internal processes for evaluating and selecting new members within these parameters.

## Delegated Authority

The General Circle operates within authority explicitly delegated by governance bodies. This authority primarily covers coordination functions and decision-making within defined boundaries. Within delegated boundaries, the Circle may:

- Facilitate communication between SuperBenefit governance bodies regarding shared resources
- Coordinate implementation of decisions affecting multiple bodies
- Prepare analysis and recommendations for governance body consideration
- Manage administrative functions explicitly delegated by governance decisions
- Convene cross-body discussions on matters affecting shared infrastructure
- Serve as arbitrator or security council of last resort for governance processes that have not delegated this role elsewhere

The Circle cannot exceed these delegated authorities or make decisions requiring governance body approval unless specifically authorized.

## Accountability

The General Circle maintains accountability through regular reporting to the governance bodies that delegate its authority. Reports are due within three months of each new revolution commencement, or every year thereafter, whichever is less. These reports should document coordination activities, implementation progress on cross-body initiatives, and any recommendations for governance consideration.

The specific format of reporting may be established by the delegating governance bodies or developed by the Circle within parameters that ensure transparency and accountability to the broader SuperBenefit community.
