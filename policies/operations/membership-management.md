# Membership Management Policy

**Status**: To be developed within 24 months of Operating Agreement effective date

## Purpose

This policy will establish the comprehensive framework for managing SuperBenefit DAO membership as referenced in the Operating Agreement. The policy must define how persons obtain membership badges and the procedures governing membership lifecycle.

## Operating Agreement Compliance Requirements

The Operating Agreement requires this policy to address:

- Mechanism for obtaining membership badges (voting/governance rights, not ownership)
- Eligibility requirements for Contributors and General Circle Members
- Acceptance of Operating Agreement and Community Agreement terms
- Voting weight determination based on membership mechanism
- Events causing automatic Member status cessation
- Procedures for new Member admission
- Integration with Community Agreements maintained in DAO State

## Key Policy Development Considerations

- **Membership Badge System**: Technical implementation of badge-based membership
- **Verification Procedures**: Identity verification and eligibility confirmation
- **Onboarding Process**: How new Members learn about and engage with SuperBenefit
- **Lifecycle Management**: Active membership, inactive status, voluntary withdrawal
- **Compliance Integration**: Restricted Person policies and sanctions compliance
- **Privacy Protection**: Member data management and privacy safeguards
- **Appeals Processes**: Fair procedures for membership disputes

## Membership Classes Framework

**Contributors**: All persons meeting eligibility requirements who accept Operating Agreement and Community Agreement terms.

**General Circle Members**: Subset of Contributors (5-6 people) with additional coordination responsibilities as defined in General Circle Policy.

## Implementation Timeline

This policy framework will be developed through SuperBenefit DAO's governance processes during the first 24 months following Operating Agreement adoption. Interim membership procedures may be established through Member governance to enable initial membership formation.

Development priorities:
1. Basic membership badge system and verification (Months 1-6)
2. Onboarding and lifecycle procedures (Months 6-12)
3. Compliance and privacy frameworks (Months 12-18)
4. Appeals and dispute resolution integration (Months 18-24)
