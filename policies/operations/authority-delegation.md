# Authority Delegation Policy

**Status**: To be developed within 24 months of Operating Agreement effective date

## Purpose

This policy will establish procedures for delegating policy-making authority to the General Circle or other groups as referenced in the Operating Agreement. The policy must enable responsive decision-making while maintaining Member oversight and revocable delegation authority.

## Operating Agreement Compliance Requirements

The Operating Agreement requires this policy to address:

- Procedures for delegating policy-making authority to General Circle or other groups
- Revocable nature of all delegations subject to Member oversight
- Documentation requirements for delegated authorities
- Oversight mechanisms ensuring delegation serves Member interests
- Procedures and limitations for binding the Company
- Integration with governance processes established in DAO State

## Key Policy Development Considerations

- **Subsidiarity Principle**: Delegation to those closest to the impact and expertise
- **Accountability Mechanisms**: Clear oversight and reporting requirements for delegated authority
- **Revocation Procedures**: Accessible processes for Members to modify or revoke delegations
- **Scope Definition**: Clear boundaries on what can/cannot be delegated
- **Documentation Standards**: Transparent tracking of delegated authorities and their use
- **Performance Evaluation**: Regular assessment of delegation effectiveness

## Delegation Framework

**Policy Domain Authority**: Delegation of policy-making within specific domains (metagovernance, operations, platforms).

**Administrative Authority**: Routine operational decisions that enable organizational function.

**Emergency Authority**: Limited, time-bound authority for urgent situations requiring immediate response.

**Project Authority**: Delegation for specific initiatives with defined scope and timeline.

## Implementation Timeline

This policy framework will be developed through SuperBenefit DAO's governance processes during the first 24 months following Operating Agreement adoption. Initial delegations may proceed through interim procedures established by Member governance.

Development priorities:
1. Basic delegation procedures and scope definition (Months 1-6)
2. Oversight and accountability mechanisms (Months 6-12)
3. Revocation and modification procedures (Months 12-18)
4. Performance evaluation and optimization frameworks (Months 18-24)
