# Resource Allocation Policy

This policy establishes SuperBenefit DAO's approach to resource allocation, emphasizing our minimal role in financial management. The DAO serves as a coordination mechanism, not a financial controller.

## Cell Autonomy

SuperBenefit cells maintain complete financial autonomy. The DAO does not manage, direct, or oversee cell treasuries. Each cell determines its own resource allocation, financial practices, and surplus distribution. This autonomy reflects our commitment to distributed decision-making and subsidiarity.

Cells direct surplus to the SuperBenefit community treasury, not to the DAO. This flow bypasses DAO involvement, maintaining clear separation between coordination functions and financial management.

## DAO Resources

The DAO itself may have minimal operational expenses for governance infrastructure. While the DAO as an entity doesn't typically control funds directly, Members may delegate spending authority to General Circle roles if operational needs arise. Any such delegation follows standard authority delegation procedures with defined scope and accountability.

## Transparency

While the DAO doesn't manage cell resources, all cells must maintain their funds onchain in known multisig wallet addresses and conduct transactions on public EVM blockchains. This requirement ensures transparency without imposing bookkeeping obligations. The DAO may facilitate coordination by providing platforms for cells to share additional financial information if they choose, but onchain transparency through public blockchain transactions remains the core requirement.
