# Resource Allocation Policy

**Status**: To be developed within 24 months of Operating Agreement effective date

## Purpose

This policy will establish procedures for additional contributions, budget management, and expense approval as referenced in the Operating Agreement. The policy must enable responsible resource stewardship while maintaining transparency and Member oversight of financial decisions.

## Operating Agreement Compliance Requirements

The Operating Agreement requires this policy to address:

- Procedures for determining additional contribution requirements
- Budget development and approval processes  
- Expense approval and reimbursement procedures
- Compensation frameworks for services advancing organizational purpose
- Prior approval requirements for expense reimbursements
- Financial procedures binding on all Members

## Key Policy Development Considerations

- **Treasury Proposal Integration**: Alignment with DAOIP-4 treasury proposal category
- **Transparency**: Clear, accessible financial reporting and decision-making
- **Member Oversight**: Appropriate governance approval for resource allocation decisions
- **Operational Efficiency**: Streamlined procedures for routine financial operations
- **Accountability**: Clear responsibility assignment and stewardship tracking
- **Compliance**: Integration with non-profit requirements and legal obligations

## Resource Management Framework

**Budget Development**: Annual and project-based budgeting processes with Member approval for significant allocations.

**Expense Management**: Approval workflows, reimbursement procedures, and expenditure tracking systems.

**Contribution Requirements**: Procedures for determining when additional Member contributions may be needed.

**Compensation Framework**: Guidelines for reasonable compensation aligned with organizational purpose and non-profit status.

## Implementation Timeline

This policy framework will be developed through SuperBenefit DAO's governance processes during the first 24 months following Operating Agreement adoption. Interim resource allocation may proceed through governance processes established in the DAO State.
