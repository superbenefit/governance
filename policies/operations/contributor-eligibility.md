# Contributor Eligibility Policy

This policy establishes the eligibility requirements for individuals to participate as Contributors in SuperBenefit DAO through Cell membership, as described in Article III.1.B of the Operating Agreement.

## Contributor Role

Contributors are individuals who participate in the Company's activities through Cells. While Contributors do not hold direct Company membership, they exercise collective governance through their Cells as established in the Operating Agreement. This policy defines the requirements for individuals to be recognized as Contributors within the SuperBenefit DAO ecosystem.

## Eligibility Requirements

To be recognized as a Contributor, individuals must:
- Hold a minimum of 1,000 $SPRB tokens
- Hold a community member role badge
- Be accepted by a Cell as a Contributor
- Accept the Operating Agreement and Community Agreements
- Comply with the Code of Conduct

The $SPRB token represents reputation and governance rights within the SuperBenefit ecosystem, not ownership or economic interest. Token holdings and badge possession are verified through onchain mechanisms, while Cell acceptance follows each Cell's internal selection processes.

## Contributor Status

Contributor status continues as long as all eligibility requirements are maintained and the individual remains associated with a Cell. Contributors are presumed to be in good standing unless placed in bad standing through formal governance action.

Bad standing results exclusively from violations of the Code of Conduct as established in CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md. Such violations must be confirmed through an operational governance proposal that evaluates the alleged violation and determines appropriate response. Contributors in bad standing may face restrictions on participation rights as determined by the governance proposal that establishes their status.

## Contributor Status Cessation

An individual's Contributor status ends when they:
- Fall below the minimum $SPRB token requirement
- Lose their community member role badge
- Voluntarily renounce their contributor role badge
- Are removed by their Cell through Cell-specific procedures
- Are removed through formal governance processes for cause

The automated nature of eligibility verification means that falling below token requirements or losing badge possession results in immediate loss of Contributor status without requiring governance action. Voluntary renunciation takes effect immediately upon renunciation. Removal by a Cell follows procedures established in the Cell Policy and individual Cell governance. Removal for cause requires explicit action through appropriate governance mechanisms.

## Relationship to Cell Membership

Contributors participate in SuperBenefit DAO governance exclusively through their Cell relationships. While Contributors do not possess direct voting rights in Company governance, Cells must ensure their contributor eligibility criteria provide Contributors with appropriate participation pathways in Cell decision-making processes. This enables Contributors to influence their Cell's positions on Company matters while maintaining the Company's Cell-based governance structure.

Individual Cells may establish additional requirements or expectations for their Contributors beyond these minimum eligibility criteria, provided such requirements do not conflict with Company policies or agreements.
