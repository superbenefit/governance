# Contributor Eligibility Policy

This policy establishes the eligibility requirements for becoming and remaining a Member of SuperBenefit DAO as required by the Operating Agreement.

## Eligibility Requirements

To become a Member, individuals must:
- Hold a minimum of 1,000 $SPRB tokens
- Hold a community member role badge
- Accept the Operating Agreement and Community Agreements
- Comply with the Code of Conduct

Eligibility verification occurs automatically through smart contract systems administered by operational governance. The smart contract validates token holdings and badge possession, creating a trustless and transparent membership system.

## Member Status

Member status continues as long as all eligibility requirements are maintained. Members are presumed to be in normal standing unless placed in bad standing through formal governance action.

Bad standing results exclusively from violations of the Code of Conduct as established in CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md. Such violations must be confirmed through an operational governance proposal that evaluates the alleged violation and determines appropriate response. Members in bad standing may face restrictions on participation rights as determined by the governance proposal that establishes their status.

## Member Status Cessation

Member status ends when an individual:
- Falls below the minimum $SPRB token requirement
- Loses their community member role badge
- Voluntarily renounces their contributor role badge
- Is removed through formal governance processes

The automated nature of eligibility verification means that falling below token requirements or losing badge possession results in immediate loss of Member status without requiring governance action. Similarly, voluntary renunciation of the contributor role badge takes effect immediately upon renunciation. Removal for cause requires explicit action through appropriate governance mechanisms. Individual cells may have additional expectations regarding vacancy and transition procedures for contributors within their teams.
