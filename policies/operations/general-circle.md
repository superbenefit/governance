# General Circle Policy

**Status**: To be developed within 24 months of Operating Agreement effective date

## Purpose

This policy will establish the operational framework for SuperBenefit DAO's General Circle as referenced in the Operating Agreement. The policy must define coordination functions while ensuring the General Circle cannot bind the Company without proper Member approval.

## Operating Agreement Compliance Requirements

The Operating Agreement requires this policy to address:

- Composition of five to six (5-6) General Circle Members
- Self-selection process for coordination functions
- Coordination responsibilities and authorities
- Relationship to broader Member governance
- Prohibition on binding the Company without Member approval
- Integration with policy domains and delegated authorities

## Key Policy Development Considerations

- **Distributed Authority**: General Circle facilitates coordination without concentrating decision-making power
- **Self-Selection Process**: Clear procedures for Contributors to join/leave General Circle
- **Coordination Scope**: Define what coordination functions fall within General Circle authority vs. requiring Member decisions
- **Accountability Mechanisms**: How General Circle remains accountable to broader membership
- **Transition Procedures**: Rotation, succession, and continuity planning
- **Authority Boundaries**: Clear limits on what General Circle can/cannot do independently

## Coordination Functions Framework

The General Circle will facilitate:
- Administrative coordination across organizational domains
- Implementation of Member-approved decisions
- Interface with external stakeholders as authorized
- Support for governance processes and Member decision-making
- Resource stewardship within approved parameters

## Implementation Timeline

This policy framework will be developed through SuperBenefit DAO's governance processes during the first 24 months following Operating Agreement adoption. Initial General Circle formation may proceed through interim procedures established by Member governance.

Development priorities:
1. Basic composition and selection procedures (Months 1-6)
2. Authority boundaries and coordination scope (Months 6-12)
3. Accountability and reporting mechanisms (Months 12-18)
4. Integration with broader governance systems (Months 18-24)
