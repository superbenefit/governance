# Multistakeholder Governance Repository Maintenance

This document establishes the framework for maintaining and evolving the Multistakeholder Governance Repository. In purpose-aligned networks, governance documentation serves as coordination infrastructure that enables diverse stakeholder groups to work together effectively while maintaining their distinct identities, needs, and contributions to collective objectives.

## Purpose and Foundational Principles

<!-- Add in concise purpose statement -->

The repository creates coordination infrastructure rather than rigid control mechanisms, establishing clear boundaries and interfaces that enable diverse stakeholder groups to coordinate spontaneously around shared purpose. This approach recognizes that the most effective multistakeholder coordination often emerges organically when appropriate frameworks exist to support it, rather than being predetermined by detailed procedures that may not accommodate stakeholder differences.

<!-- Add appropriate governance.md content here
- The goal of SuperBenefit's governance.md file is somewhat unique, since it sits within our governance state repository. That means this govenance file should serve a "Metagovernance" role in the repository; It should explain how changes to the actual contents of this repository are made, how changes integrate with SuperBenefit's governance system (use placeholders or ask for help if you don't know how SuperBenefit's governance works yet) and how those changes effect the organization.
  - This page should explain the actual process used to modify the content of this repo, linking to the relevant metagovernance policies governing those processes. The governance.md file is where the rules, norms and history are translated into the specific, practical instructions for interacting with and evolving SuperBenefit's governance.
    - Agreements are modified by their respective membership class: Community agreements are governed by community members and modified via community governance, operational agreements are governed by contributors via operational governance, etc.
      - Agreements are always created or modified via proposals made to their respective governance bodies. Separating governance bodies by membership class ensures that no one body can bind another to an agreement; They can only bind themselves to each other and to SuperBenefit.
      - Agreements which explicitly effect all membership classes (as opposed to implicitly effecting all classes like how community agreements (as the base role) effect contributors) are constitutional in nature because they effect how the membership classes organize into a whole network. Thus they go in constitution.md, rather than in a particular agreement directory. We will adopt constitution.md later.
    - Policies are governed by the same governance bodies which govern agreements. Those bodies may make high-level policy decisions directly via their proposal process, but typically delegate their policy making authority via agreements, forming new policy domains. Domains are always delegated to roles, cells, or circles (like the general circle). These are all collectively called roles regardless of the entities which hold them.
      - Policies can be added via proposal by the governance body owning that policy domain, or by decision from the delegated policymaker role. Policymakers are free to decide their own processes for managing policies and must publish it somewhere public (like their cell state). Most policy-making roles choose to adopt whatever governance process they're already using for agreements.
    - Proposals can be added by any authorized proposer to any governance space which they can access, and all policies for who is an authorized proposer will be published in the policies directory. consider the metagovernance policies for proposals, voting and state updates to be the default rules unless overridden by a specific policy domain for the proposal in question.
      - Proposals are made by submitting a pull request to this repository containing the proposed changes to the DAO state. The proposal itself is a document which proposes the change and summarized the exact changes which will be made to the DAO state.
      - Not all proposals (other than metagovernance proposals) will require changes to the DAO state. proposals like spending funds, electing role-holders or other typical governance actions probably require no modification of this repo other than simply adding the proposal to the archive.
  - It's okay if you don't know how SuperBenefit's governance works yet. We'll be adding in our agreements and governance history later. For now, this page should serve as a starting place  which we'll iterate on throughout the content import process.
  - There
- Here's an example of a governance.md file in a random project: https://github.com/citation-file-format/governance/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md
- We should use this page to outline the various content needed in the governance.md file, for later update. It should be well-organized, fully considered and effectively documented so as to make future updates to this file easy and clean. -->
