# OPERATING AGREEMENT OF SUPERBENEFIT DAO LLC

**NOTICE OF RESTRICTIONS ON DUTIES AND TRANSFERS**

*The rights of members in a decentralized autonomous organization may differ materially from the rights of members in other resident domestic or non-resident domestic limited liability companies. The DAO Act, underlying smart contracts, certificate of formation, and limited liability company agreement (i.e., the operating agreement), if applicable, of a decentralized autonomous organization may define, reduce, or eliminate fiduciary duties and may restrict the transfer of ownership interests, withdrawal or resignation from the decentralized autonomous organization, return of capital contributions and dissolution of the decentralized autonomous organization.*

This Operating Agreement ("the Agreement") of SuperBenefit DAO LLC, a non-profit limited liability company (the "Company") incorporated as per the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands pursuant to the Marshall Islands Limited Liability Company Act of 1996 (as amended, the "LLC Act"), the Marshall Islands Non-Profit Entities (Amendment) Act of 2021 (as amended, the "Non-Profit Act"), the Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act (as amended, the "BCA") and the Decentralized Autonomous Organization Act, 2022 (as amended, the "DAO Act"), by and among the Company and the persons executing this Agreement (individually "Member" and collectively "Members"), causing the filing of the certificate of formation of the Company (the "Certificate of Formation"), with the Marshall Islands Registrar of Corporations shall be effective as of the date of the issuance of the Certificate of Formation ("the Effective Date"). Capitalized terms have the same meaning as those defined in the relevant law.

**WHEREAS**, in pursuit of compliance with a fit-for-purpose legal regime that seeks to protect members and support innovation, the Members of the Company approved the incorporation of the Company as a Marshall Islands non-profit limited liability company and decentralized autonomous organization.

**NOW, THEREFORE**, for and in consideration of mutual covenants contained and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

## ARTICLE I - ORGANIZATION

I.2 **Decentralized Autonomous Organization.** The Company is a decentralized autonomous organization within the meaning of ยง102(c) and ยง104(1) and (3) of the DAO Act, whereby the notice of restrictions on duties and transfers appears conspicuously at the beginning of this Agreement.

I.3 **Registered Office; Registered Agent.** The registered office of the Company in the Marshall Islands shall be the initial registered office designated in the Certificate of Formation or such other office as provided by law. The registered agent of the Company in the Marshall Islands shall be the initial registered agent designated in the Certificate of Formation.

I.4 **Principal Office.** The Principal Office of the Company shall be at the principal office designated in the Certificate of Formation or at such other location as the Members may designate from time to time, which need not be in the Marshall Islands. The Company shall maintain a Digital Infrastructure Policy in the DAO State that establishes official online venues, repository management procedures, and public access protocols.

The Company shall participate in governance coordination with other bodies within the SuperBenefit network, including the SuperBenefit Community and coordination bodies as established in this Agreement. This organizational structure shall:

A. Enable the Company to maintain exclusive authority over business operations while the SuperBenefit Community retains autonomous authority over cultural and social matters;

B. Permit persons who participate in SuperBenefit community activities but who are not Members of the Company to engage in such activities without thereby incurring liability for or legal association with the Company's business operations;

C. Provide for the Company to receive specified rights and benefits through agreements with the SuperBenefit Community, which rights may include but are not limited to trademark and brand usage, access to community platforms, and participation in community support systems, all as may be established through governance agreements between the respective bodies;

D. Establish coordination mechanisms through onchain governance infrastructure that enables shared governance authority among the various bodies within the SuperBenefit network.

## ARTICLE II - PURPOSES AND POWERS

II.1 **Nonprofit Character.** The Company shall be a non-profit entity within the meaning of the Non-Profit Act and may exercise the powers and privileges conferred upon limited liability companies by the laws of the Marshall Islands only in furtherance of and subject to its company purpose.

II.2 **Purposes of the Company.** To research and incubate initiatives that harness emerging technologies and practices in pursuit of systems transformation.

II.3 **Authority of the Company.** The Company shall have and exercise all of the powers and authority conferred by Marshall Islands law on an entity recognized as a decentralized autonomous organization limited liability company with non-profit status, and insofar as this entity form is recognized by foreign laws as a legal person separate and distinct from its Members, then the Company shall also have all of the powers and authority as conferred by those foreign laws.

II.4 **No Private Inurement.** No part of its assets, income, or earnings shall inure to the benefit of, or be distributable to, any person or individual, including a Member or non-Member or any private individual of the Company, during the life or upon dissolution of the Company, except:

A. In accordance with the advancement of the Company's purpose;

B. Its activities do not exclusively involve disseminating propaganda or otherwise attempting to influence legislation; and

## ARTICLE III - MEMBERS

III.1 **Participant Classes.** The Company recognizes two classes of participants:

A. **Cells**: Autonomous teams that carry out SuperBenefit's purpose, which constitute the Company's Members. Cells are identified by ownership of permissioned multisignature wallets, and participate in operational governance through consensus mechanisms established in the DAO State. Technical implementation details for Cell identification shall be specified in the Cell Policy.

B. **Contributors**: Individuals who participate in the Company's activities through Cells. While Contributors do not hold direct Company membership, they exercise collective governance through their Cells. Contributors are identified by Cell-issued role badges and participate in Cell governance as established in the DAO State. Technical implementation details for Contributor identification shall be specified in the Contributor Eligibility Policy.

III.2 **Eligibility and Accountability.** The Company shall maintain eligibility criteria for all participants through policies in the DAO State. Cells shall ensure their operations and Contributors' conduct comply with applicable Company policies.

All operational policies, formation processes, and accountability structures shall be detailed in the Cell Eligibility Policy, Contributor Eligibility Policy, Cell Policy, and DAO Member Policy in the DAO State.

III.4 **Voting Rights.** Only Cells exercise voting rights in Company governance. Contributors possess no direct voting rights and participate in governance exclusively through their Cell relationships.

Voting mechanisms, delegation procedures, and decision-making frameworks shall be established in the Voting Policy and Cell Policy in the DAO State.

## ARTICLE IV - RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF MEMBERS

IV.1 **Management Rights.** All Cell Members who have not Dissociated (as defined in Article VIII) shall be entitled to vote on any matter submitted to a vote of the Members in accordance with the Voting Policy in the DAO State.

IV.2 **Liability of Members.** No Member shall be liable for the liabilities of the Company unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement or any governance rules approved in accordance with this Agreement. The failure of the Company to observe any formalities or requirements relating to the exercise of its powers or management of its business or affairs under this Agreement shall not be grounds for imposing personal liability on the Members for liabilities of the Company.

IV.3 **No fiduciary duties unless expressly approved.** In accordance with ยง109 of the DAO Act, no Member shall have any fiduciary duty to the Company or any Member unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement or any governance rules approved in accordance with this Agreement.

IV.5 **Miscellaneous Obligations.** Each Member shall be duty-bound to act consistently and in compliance with each of the provisions of this Agreement and with all policies, rules, and decisions of the Company adopted in accordance with the DAO State governance framework.

## ARTICLE V - MANAGEMENT

V.1 **Member-Managed.** The Company shall be member-managed. Members shall make decisions through governance processes established in the DAO State, including the Voting Policy and other metagovernance policies. Governance activities carried out by the Members of the Company constitute "Operational Governance" for purposes of this Agreement. The General Circle, further defined in Article V.5, serves as a coordination body within Operational Governance.

V.2 **Policy Domains.** The Company's activities shall be organized through policy domains as established in the DAO State. Operational governance has authority over Operational Policies, which govern work coordination, resource allocation, and contributor activities. Operational governance may create sub-domains within Operational Policies and delegate authority to create or update policies within those sub-domains.

V.3 **Authority Delegation.** The Company shall maintain an Authority Delegation Policy in the DAO State that establishes procedures for delegating policy-making authority to the General Circle or other groups. All delegations must remain revocable and subject to Member oversight as established in such policy. Members are bound by the delegation procedures and oversight requirements established in such policy.

V.4 **Authority to Bind Company.** Only Members acting in accordance with the governance processes established in the DAO State shall have the authority to bind the Company. Operational governance may create governance bodies with authority to bind the Company within defined scopes, or delegate such authority to specific roles or entities within particular boundaries. The Authority Delegation Policy in the DAO State shall establish the specific procedures, limitations, and accountability mechanisms for binding the Company.

V.5 **Operational Governance and Delegation.** Operational governance authority is exercised by Cells through consensus mechanisms established in Company policies. Recognizing the coordination requirements of multi-Cell consensus:

A. Operational governance may delegate specific authorities to facilitate effective coordination, as detailed in the Authority Delegation Policy.

B. The General Circle, as established in the General Circle Policy, serves as the default delegate for all operational authorities that are not otherwise delegated or reserved for formal Cell consensus processes. This ensures operational effectiveness while maintaining Member oversight.

C. All delegations remain revocable and subject to Member oversight through mechanisms established in Company policies.

A. A current directory of all Members; or

B. A clear reference to the mechanism by which the current list of Cell Members may be obtained from onchain data.

## ARTICLE VII - CONTRIBUTIONS

VII.1 **Initial Contributions.** The minimum initial contributions required to establish the Company have been made. The Company shall maintain a Resource Allocation Policy in the DAO State that establishes procedures for additional contributions, budget management, and expense approval.

## ARTICLE VIII - DISSOCIATION OF A MEMBER

VIII.1 **Member Status Cessation.** 

A. **Cell Members**: A Cell shall cease to be a Member automatically upon:

   1. Voluntary renunciation of their role badge, which takes effect immediately;
   2. Revocation by their Cell; or
   3. Procedures established in the Contributor Eligibility Policy and DAO Member Policy.

Each class shall have cessation procedures appropriate to its structure, including voluntary withdrawal and involuntary removal processes, as detailed in their respective policies in the DAO State.

VIII.2 **No Distribution on Cessation of Member Status.** The voluntary or involuntary cessation of a person's Member status does not give rise to any right of a Member to a distribution of any property or economic resources that may be or become available to the Company.

A. **New Cell Members**: New Cells may become Members by meeting the eligibility requirements specified in the Cell Eligibility Policy and following admission procedures established in the Cell Policy.
