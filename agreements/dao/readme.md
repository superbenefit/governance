# SuperBenefit Operational Agreements

SuperBenefit's operational agreements establish the governance frameworks that enable us to coordinate effectively as an organization advancing regenerative economics. These agreements define decision-making processes, resource allocation systems, and coordination mechanisms that allow diverse contributors to work together productively while maintaining alignment with our mission of economic transformation that supports human and ecological wellbeing.

## Operational Governance for Regenerative Economics

SuperBenefit's operational governance reflects our commitment to demonstrating that organizational coordination can embody regenerative principles rather than reproducing extractive patterns common in traditional economic structures. Our operational agreements create frameworks that distribute authority appropriately, support contributor autonomy, and maintain accountability to our collective mission.

These agreements recognize that advancing regenerative economics requires both specialized expertise and collaborative integration across different domains of knowledge and practice. They establish structures that enable deep work within specific areas while maintaining coordination across our interconnected efforts in research, community development, technical innovation, and ecosystem building.

SuperBenefit's operational approach balances efficiency with inclusivity, recognizing that both are essential for sustainable impact. Our agreements create pathways for timely decision-making when needed while ensuring that significant choices reflect input from relevant perspectives and affected communities. This reflects our understanding that regenerative economics must be both effective and authentic to diverse stakeholder needs.

The operational framework embodies our principle of minimum viable coordination, establishing just enough structure to enable productive collaboration without creating unnecessary bureaucracy. These agreements focus on clarifying interfaces between different working domains while preserving autonomy for contributors to develop approaches that serve their specific contexts and capabilities.

## General Circle Model and Domain Coordination

SuperBenefit's operational governance centers around our General Circle model, which distributes coordination responsibilities across 5-6 active contributors who maintain oversight of different organizational domains while working collaboratively on strategic direction and resource allocation.

The General Circle serves as a coordination hub rather than a traditional management layer, facilitating information flow between different working areas and ensuring that specialized efforts remain connected to our broader mission of regenerative economics advancement. Circle members bring different areas of expertise and maintain relationships with various stakeholder communities, enabling decision-making that reflects diverse perspectives.

Our domain-based organization recognizes that effective regenerative economics work requires both focused expertise and collaborative integration. Different domains – such as research and development, community engagement, technical infrastructure, and ecosystem partnerships – maintain operational autonomy while coordinating through established interfaces and shared resource allocation processes.

Contributors move between domains based on interests, capacity, and organizational needs, with pathways established for both short-term collaboration and longer-term role transitions. This fluidity supports personal development while building organizational resilience through distributed knowledge and relationships across different areas of SuperBenefit's work.

## Resource Stewardship and Contribution Recognition

SuperBenefit's operational agreements establish frameworks for responsible stewardship of shared resources in ways that support our regenerative economics mission. These frameworks recognize that effective resource allocation requires both technical competence and alignment with our values of abundance consciousness and equitable access.

Resource decisions balance investment in current productive capacity with development of longer-term capabilities needed for sustainable impact. Our agreements create transparency about resource availability and allocation while maintaining flexibility for emerging opportunities that advance our mission in unexpected ways.

Contribution recognition in SuperBenefit acknowledges the diverse ways people support regenerative economics development, from technical work and governance participation to community building and relationship maintenance. Our agreements establish frameworks for acknowledging and supporting different types of contribution while maintaining focus on collective impact rather than individual accumulation.

The operational framework includes mechanisms for contributor development and mutual support, recognizing that advancing regenerative economics often requires developing capabilities that many of us learned differently in traditional economic contexts. These mechanisms support both individual growth and organizational learning through shared reflection and skill development.

## Integration with Community Culture

SuperBenefit's operational agreements build upon the cultural foundations established through our community agreements, creating governance structures that express and reinforce our shared values rather than existing as separate technical systems. This integration ensures that our organizational effectiveness serves our broader mission of cultural transformation toward regenerative economics.

Decision-making processes incorporate the relational skills and inclusive practices developed through community participation, ensuring that operational efficiency does not compromise our commitment to honoring diverse perspectives and collaborative wisdom. Contributors move fluidly between community and operational contexts, carrying insights between these complementary domains of SuperBenefit's work.

Operational governance includes regular reflection on how well our structures are serving both effectiveness and values alignment, with mechanisms for adaptation based on collective learning. These reflection processes engage both operational contributors and broader community participants, maintaining accountability to our shared mission rather than operational convenience.

SuperBenefit's operational agreements evolve through established governance processes that welcome input from different types of contributors while maintaining coherent organizational function. Changes reflect genuine improvements in our capacity for regenerative economics coordination rather than temporary reactions to specific challenges or pressures.

## Participating in Operational Governance

Contributors engage with SuperBenefit's operational governance through multiple pathways that accommodate different interests, capacities, and time availabilities. We recognize that effective organizational coordination benefits from diverse perspectives and that rigid participation requirements can exclude valuable contributions.

Operational participation ranges from project-based collaboration and domain-specific work to governance circle engagement and strategic planning involvement. Contributors develop their engagement based on personal interests and organizational needs, with support available for developing governance skills and understanding organizational coordination.

SuperBenefit's operational agreements create transparency about decision-making authorities and accountability mechanisms while maintaining openness to emerging forms of contribution that strengthen our regenerative economics work. We encourage all contributors to understand governance frameworks while recognizing that deep operational involvement serves some contributors better than others.

Our operational governance serves SuperBenefit's mission of advancing regenerative economics through demonstration of organizational coordination that embodies principles of reciprocity, transparency, and shared abundance. By developing operational excellence aligned with our values, we create models that can inspire and inform broader economic transformation efforts.
