# SuperBenefit Agreement Registry

Welcome to SuperBenefit's agreements repository, where we maintain foundational documents that establish relationships within our community and organization. As explained in our [main governance documentation](../index.md), agreements focus on relationships between participants while policies translate these relationships into operational frameworks.

## Understanding Agreements in Our Governance

Agreements play a distinctive role in our governance ecosystem. They create the foundation for coordination by making expectations explicit between different parties. Unlike policies that govern systems or processes, agreements focus on relationships – between individual members and the SuperBenefit community, among teams, between contributors and SuperBenefit DAO, and with external partners.

What makes agreements powerful in our context is their mutual nature. When someone joins the SuperBenefit community or takes on a role within SuperBenefit DAO, they enter into these agreements willingly. This mutual commitment creates both trust and accountability. Clear agreements enable autonomous action while maintaining alignment with our shared purpose – participants can act independently knowing the boundaries and expectations that guide their participation.

Agreements tend to be more stable than policies, changing less frequently but with broader impact when they do change. Many require explicit consent, especially those that establish formal rights and obligations. This consent-based approach ensures that everyone operating within SuperBenefit does so with a shared understanding of their relationship to the whole.

## Where to Find Our Agreements

Our agreements are organized to reflect SuperBenefit's dual governance structure:

The [Community](community/) directory contains agreements applying to all SuperBenefit participants, establishing cultural foundations and behavioral expectations across our ecosystem.

The [DAO](dao/) directory houses operational agreements governing SuperBenefit DAO's formal structures, addressing decision-making, resource allocation, and work coordination among contributors with organizational roles.

This distinction between community and operational domains reflects a key governance principle: different contexts require different frameworks. By separating these agreement types, we can develop governance that appropriately addresses both the cultural and structural elements of our ecosystem while maintaining coherence between them.

As SuperBenefit evolves, this registry will grow to include new agreements and updated versions of existing ones. All changes follow our established governance processes, ensuring our agreements continue to reflect our collective understanding of how we work together. This evolution reflects our commitment to governance that adapts while maintaining the trust and clarity that effective collaboration requires.
