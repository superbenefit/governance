# SuperBenefit Agreement Registry

Welcome to SuperBenefit's agreements repository, where we maintain the foundational documents that define relationships within our community and organization. While policies guide our systems and processes, agreements establish the social contracts between participants – they clarify expectations, rights, and responsibilities that enable us to work together effectively.

## Understanding Agreements in Our Governance

Agreements play a distinctive role in our governance ecosystem. They create the foundation for coordination by making expectations explicit between different parties. Unlike policies that govern systems or processes, agreements focus on relationships – between individual members and the SuperBenefit community, among teams, between contributors and SuperBenefit DAO, and with external partners.

What makes agreements powerful in our context is their mutual nature. When someone joins the SuperBenefit community or takes on a role within SuperBenefit DAO, they enter into these agreements willingly. This mutual commitment creates both trust and accountability. Clear agreements enable autonomous action while maintaining alignment with our shared purpose – participants can act independently knowing the boundaries and expectations that guide their participation.

Agreements tend to be more stable than policies, changing less frequently but with broader impact when they do change. Many require explicit consent, especially those that establish formal rights and obligations. This consent-based approach ensures that everyone operating within SuperBenefit does so with a shared understanding of their relationship to the whole.

## Types of Agreements in SuperBenefit

Our governance model incorporates several distinct types of agreements, each serving a different purpose in defining relationships:

Membership agreements establish the fundamental relationship between individual participants and the SuperBenefit community. They define what makes someone a member, what rights that confers, and what responsibilities come with membership. These agreements create clarity about who is part of the community and what that means in practice within our collaborative framework.

Group agreements govern how teams and circles work together and interface with the rest of SuperBenefit. They establish decision-making boundaries, coordination mechanisms, and accountability frameworks that allow groups to function effectively within the larger system. These include agreements for working domains and other collaborative structures.

Role agreements clarify the authority and responsibilities of specific functions within SuperBenefit DAO. Unlike traditional job descriptions, these agreements focus on how the role relates to other parts of the system – what authority it has, what accountabilities it holds, and how it interfaces with other roles. This is particularly important for General Circle members and domain coordinators.

Network agreements establish relationships with external partners and stakeholders. They define how SuperBenefit collaborates with other organizations, what resources or information we share, and how we maintain alignment while working across organizational boundaries.

## Where to Find Our Agreements

In this repository, our agreements are organized into categories that reflect different relationship domains and governance contexts:

The [Community](community/) directory contains agreements that apply to everyone who participates in the SuperBenefit ecosystem. These agreements focus on interpersonal dynamics and behavioral expectations that create a healthy, inclusive environment for all participants. Community agreements typically apply regardless of someone's formal relationship with SuperBenefit DAO, creating a consistent cultural foundation across all spaces and activities.

The [DAO](dao/) directory houses operational agreements that govern the formal structures and processes of SuperBenefit DAO. These agreements address how decisions are made, how resources are allocated, and how work is coordinated among those with specific roles and responsibilities within the organization. Operational agreements typically involve more explicit commitments and apply to contributors actively engaged in SuperBenefit DAO's work.

This distinction between community and operational domains reflects a key governance principle: different contexts require different frameworks. By separating these agreement types, we can develop governance that appropriately addresses both the cultural and structural elements of our ecosystem while maintaining coherence between them.

As SuperBenefit evolves, this registry will grow to include new agreements and updated versions of existing ones. All changes follow our established governance processes, ensuring our agreements continue to reflect our collective understanding of how we work together. This evolution reflects our commitment to governance that adapts while maintaining the trust and clarity that effective collaboration requires.
