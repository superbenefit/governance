# SuperBenefit Community Agreements

SuperBenefit's community agreements establish the cultural foundation for all participation in our network. These agreements apply to everyone who engages with SuperBenefit activities, creating shared understanding that enables diverse perspectives and contributions to flourish within supportive collaborative environments.

## Creating Culture for Transformation

SuperBenefit's community culture reflects our understanding that sustainable transformation requires more than technical innovation or policy change – it demands new patterns of relationship that embody the principles we seek to advance. Our community agreements make explicit the values and behaviors that create conditions for this cultural transformation.

These agreements acknowledge that many of us come from contexts that have normalized scarcity mindsets, extractive relationships, and competitive dynamics. Creating alternatives requires intentional practice in developing abundance consciousness, mutualistic coordination, and collaborative problem-solving – skills that many of us are learning together as part of SuperBenefit's community development.

## Inclusive Participation in Transformation

SuperBenefit's community agreements emphasize inclusive participation that honors the diverse ways people contribute to our work. We recognize that transformation requires insights from many different lived experiences, professional backgrounds, cultural contexts, and ways of understanding the world.

These agreements create space for different forms of contribution, from technical development and research to community organizing and storytelling. They acknowledge that advancing our mission may involve different types of activities in different contexts, and that effective network coordination requires appreciation for this diversity rather than attempts to standardize all contributions.

The agreements establish expectations for mutual respect across differences in perspective, approach, and capacity. They encourage participants to share their unique insights while remaining open to learning from others' experiences and expertise. This creates conditions for innovative synthesis that emerges from genuine collaboration across diverse viewpoints.

SuperBenefit's community culture values accessibility and works actively to reduce barriers to participation. Our agreements guide creation of multiple pathways for engagement that accommodate different time availabilities, technical comfort levels, and preferred forms of interaction. They encourage participants to support each other's engagement rather than creating hierarchies based on particular types of contribution.

## Constructive Engagement and Conflict Transformation

SuperBenefit recognizes that meaningful work on transformation inevitably involves navigating disagreements about strategies, priorities, and approaches. Our community agreements provide frameworks for engaging with these differences constructively rather than avoiding or suppressing them.

These agreements encourage direct, respectful communication about concerns while acknowledging that different people have different communication styles and conflict comfort levels. They create pathways for raising issues and seeking resolution that honor both individual needs and collective wellbeing.

When conflicts arise, SuperBenefit's approach emphasizes learning and relationship repair over punishment or exclusion. We understand that developing new patterns of relationship requires patience with ourselves and others as we collectively build skills for coordination that support our principles.

The agreements establish processes for addressing situations where behavior undermines community wellbeing or conflicts with SuperBenefit's mission. These processes prioritize restoration and learning while maintaining appropriate boundaries that protect community safety and cultural integrity.

## Community Agreement Evolution

SuperBenefit's community agreements evolve through participatory processes that welcome input from all network participants. We recognize that our understanding of effective community culture continues developing through our collective experience and learning.

Changes to community agreements occur through established governance processes that ensure broad input and careful consideration of impacts on different types of participants. These processes balance responsiveness to emerging needs with stability that allows community culture to develop over time.

All SuperBenefit participants are encouraged to share their perspectives on how well community agreements are serving our mission and relationships. We create multiple opportunities for this input, recognizing that different people communicate most effectively in different contexts and formats.

Our community agreements serve SuperBenefit's broader mission of demonstrating that coordination can embody principles of regeneration, reciprocity, and shared abundance. By practicing these principles in our community culture, we develop both the relationships and the skills needed for advancing our work in broader contexts where we live and operate.
