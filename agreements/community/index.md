# SuperBenefit Community Agreements

This section contains the agreements that establish shared expectations and behavioral norms for all SuperBenefit community participants, regardless of their formal role or level of involvement with SuperBenefit DAO.

## Universal Application in SuperBenefit

Community agreements create the cultural foundation for healthy interactions within SuperBenefit's spaces. They apply to everyone who participates in our activities – from casual visitors to active contributors to SuperBenefit DAO. These agreements focus on interpersonal dynamics rather than operational processes, establishing consistent standards across all SuperBenefit community contexts.

By clearly articulating behavioral expectations, we create an environment where diverse people can engage authentically while respecting necessary boundaries. This clarity benefits both newcomers and longtime SuperBenefit community members, providing consistency across our various activities and spaces. The agreements reflect SuperBenefit's commitment to inclusive collaboration and respectful interaction.

## Who These Agreements Cover

These agreements govern all forms of community engagement within SuperBenefit:

**Community members** who participate in discussions, attend events, or engage with SuperBenefit's content across various platforms. Whether learning about our work or contributing to conversations, all participants agree to uphold our behavioral standards. This foundation enables the kind of collaborative environment that SuperBenefit depends on.

**Event attendees** at both online and in-person SuperBenefit gatherings enter our spaces knowing these agreements guide participation. Event-specific guidelines may supplement but never override these foundational standards. This ensures consistency across all SuperBenefit community interactions.

**SuperBenefit DAO contributors** working on projects operate under these agreements alongside any operational agreements related to their specific roles. Community agreements provide the relational foundation upon which project collaboration builds, ensuring that all work maintains our community standards.

**SuperBenefit DAO members** with formal responsibilities remain bound by these agreements in all interactions. Leadership roles carry particular responsibility to model the values expressed here, demonstrating how SuperBenefit's community standards support effective collaboration.

## Relationship to SuperBenefit DAO's Organizational Structure

Community agreements and SuperBenefit DAO's formal organizational structure support each other symbiotically. For community members, SuperBenefit DAO provides structure through which collective values translate into coordinated action and tangible impact.

These agreements extend beyond formal organizational boundaries, creating continuity across different engagement levels within SuperBenefit. They apply equally whether someone participates casually in the community or holds formal responsibilities within SuperBenefit DAO, ensuring consistent culture regardless of role. This universal application helps maintain SuperBenefit's collaborative character across all contexts.

When community agreements and SuperBenefit DAO's organizational practices become misaligned, this creates confusion about expectations and undermines trust in governance processes. Maintaining alignment between cultural standards and operational practice serves both domains, fostering coherence that enables authentic participation throughout SuperBenefit.

When conflicts arise regarding community agreements, resolution focuses on restoration and learning rather than punishment. This approach recognizes that SuperBenefit's community health depends on balancing accountability with understanding, supporting resilient relationships that enable effective collaboration over time. Our conflict resolution processes reflect SuperBenefit's broader commitment to constructive problem-solving and continuous improvement.

## SuperBenefit's Distinctive Approach to Community

SuperBenefit's community agreements reflect our understanding that sustainable transformation requires more than technical innovation or policy change – it demands new patterns of relationship that embody regenerative principles. We explicitly acknowledge that many participants come from contexts that normalized scarcity mindsets and extractive dynamics, making intentional practice in abundance consciousness and mutualistic coordination essential skills we develop together.

Our restoration-based approach to conflict resolution exemplifies this commitment. Rather than focusing on punishment or exclusion, we prioritize learning and relationship repair, recognizing that community resilience emerges from our collective capacity to navigate differences constructively. This approach supports the kind of authentic, long-term collaboration that enables meaningful social transformation.

For those interested in contributing more formally to SuperBenefit's work, our [operational agreements](../dao/) build upon these community foundations to establish structures for coordinated action. Understanding both sets of agreements helps participants navigate different levels of engagement while maintaining alignment with our shared values.
