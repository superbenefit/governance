# Community Behavioral Guidelines

**Status**: To be developed through community governance processes

This agreement will establish the behavioral expectations and cultural foundations for all SuperBenefit community participants. 

## Development Process

Community agreements are created through inclusive community governance processes that welcome input from all participants. These agreements focus on interpersonal dynamics, communication norms, and shared values that create the cultural foundation for SuperBenefit's work.

## Placeholder Framework

Until formal community agreements are established through governance processes, participants are encouraged to engage with respect, curiosity, and good faith as outlined in the Operating Agreement's covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

Community agreements will address areas such as:
- Communication norms and practices
- Conflict engagement approaches
- Participation expectations
- Community boundaries and accountability

The development of these agreements represents an opportunity for the community to collectively define its cultural foundations through participatory governance.
